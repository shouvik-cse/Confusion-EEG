# Confusion-EEG
Confusion Level Detection using EEG Signal
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect confusion levels using EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The system aims to classify different states of confusion in real time by analysing brainwave data collected during cognitive tasks. The goal is to develop an effective tool that can enhance adaptive learning systems, cognitive monitoring, and user-centred interfaces by understanding and responding to usersâ€™ mental states.
