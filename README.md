# Abstract
There are several fields, including education, healthcare, and human-computer interaction, where 
it is crucial to be able to accurately assess someone's cognitive state, particularly how confused 
they are. The effectiveness of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing for the detection 
and quantification of levels of astonishment is thoroughly evaluated in this work. In our 
fastpaced, information-driven culture, understanding and analyzing confusion has enormous 
ramifications for decision-making processes in education, healthcare, and human-computer 
interaction. Because it offers a non-invasive means to evaluate mental states and emotional 
responses, EEG is a viable approach for studying confusion. More research is needed to learn 
how to recognize confusion in learning and what EEG signals indicate its existence because the 
study of confusion in learning is still in its early stages. EEG data provide a clear window into 
cognitive processes and essential information about the electrical activity of the brain. Even 
though it is unpleasant, the learner must understand deep learning in order to participate in it. 
This study's categorization phase extensively utilizes machine learning methods. Furthermore, 
we find that the primary element for identifying brain confusion in the EEG signal is the gamma 
1 wave. Heng Cui et al. claim that by suggesting a data-driven strategy for identifying and 
quantifying the level of perplexity via EEG signal analysis, this study initiative closes a large 
understanding gap in cognitive states. By enhancing our capacity to track cognitive states, this 
study advances the larger goal of enhancing human-computer interaction, education, and 
healthcare procedures.  


Keywords: Human-computer interaction, gamma 1 wave, machine learning, electrical activity,
